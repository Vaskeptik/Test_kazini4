							<strong>1. Introduction</strong>
							<p>1.1. The Company accepts bets from Clients on the basis
								of a pre-game - a list of events with certain winning odds, and live betting, on certain participating
								events, at the discretion of the Company.</p>
							<p>1.2. Betting Rules add on to the general
								Terms and Conditions of the website and do not in any way contradict with them. In case of a dispute,
								terms stated in the Terms and Conditions have advantage over those in Betting
								Rules.2.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="static-page__paragraph">
							<strong>2. Procedure for bet acceptance</strong>
							<p>2.1. In order to place a bet client is required to
								register an account and meet the requirements listed under the general Terms and Conditions.</p>
							<p>2.2. Before placing a bet it is clients;
								responsibility to get familiar with the conditions of bet acceptance and any formulas related to the
								calculation of winnings.</p>
							<p>2.3. Bets are accepted only from users who agree with the
								rules established by the Company. Every placed bet is an unconditional confirmation that the Client
								understands these rules and fully agrees with them.</p>
							<p>2.4. All bets are accepted before the actual start of the
								event, except live bets. Bets made after the actual start of the event, regardless of the reason, are
								recognized as invalid and are refundable, and are excluded from the Accumulator (pay out with the odds
								of "1"). The exception to this is betting on events during the match in live betting.</p>
							<p>2.5. Live bets are bets that are accepted during an event
								at the discretion of the Company. In this case, bets can only be accepted before determining the outcome
								of the event. Bets made after determining the outcome of an event are considered invalid and voided. The
								information given by the Company during the reception of live bets (match account, played time, etc.) is
								only informative and can not serve as a basis for bet settlements or for claims against the
								Company.</p>
							<p>2.6. The Company has the right to return the amount of a
								bet made at any time before the actual start of the event. In this case, the bets made (the bids made)
								are recognized as invalid, which the Company reports by appropriate changes in the pre-game or through
								other sources of information.</p>
							<p>It is forbidden to bet on events by those who are
								participating or are directly related to said events in question. For example: players, coaches,
								referees, club owners, etc. When making a bet, the client thereby confirms that he does not know the
								outcome of the event he has bet on. In the case of violation of these conditions, the Company has the
								right to withhold any winnings and declare the bet invalid.</p>
							<p>2.7. In all cases when the bet is recognized as invalid,
								it is subject to return. If the bet is included in Accumulator bets or Multi bets, then it must be
								calculated with the odds of "1" (one), i.e. it will not affect the results of other events included in
								Accumulator bets or Multiple bets.</p>
							<p>2.8. All bets are accepted based on the events of the
								proposed pre-game, according to the odds determined by the Company. For each event in the program a
								separate number is allocated, as well as the deadline and the time of accepting bets for the event. The
								date and time of the beginning of the event, indicated in the pre-game, are informative. A wrong date is
								not a substantial reason for canceling a bet. In the case that the event took place earlier or later
								than the originally announced date, the result is not considered void. In this case, bets are considered
								valid if they are made before the actual start of the event. Bets made after the actual start of the
								event are considered void (except live bets). To settle the bet, the time of the actual start of the
								event is taken, which is determined based on the information provided by the event organizers.
							</p>
							<p>The Event column shows the names of competing teams or
								events to which bets are accepted. In the list of events, the home team is indicated in the first spot.
								In the case of a match on the field of the team listed in the second spot in the list of events, the bet
								for this match is calculated with the odds of "1" (one), except for the following cases:</p>
							<p>a) both teams are from the same city;</p>
							<p>b) games are held in the same city, in the case of
								international tournaments - in one country;</p>
							<p>c) the final round of the cup games of a country;
							</p>
							<p>The transfer of games to a neutral field is not grounds
								for recognizing a bet as invalid.</p>
							<p>There can also be other information in the pre-game that
								is of significant importance when making a bet, this allows the Client to correctly use the service, as
								well as to understand the meaning and essence of the conventional symbols used throughout the
								website.</p>
							<p>2.9. In individual tennis tournaments, as well as in
								matches of the final stage of major tournaments held in one country, the order of opponents in a pair is
								not important.</p>
							<p>2.10. If an event that has not yet started is postponed
								for no longer than 24 hours, the bets are retained, and if more than 24 hours, the bets are refundable,
								if nothing else is stipulated by this regulation. If within 24 hours it becomes known that the event is
								postponed for more than 24 hours, the final decision as to whether the stakes will remain in force or
								will be returned is up to the discretion of the Company's bookmaking office. If the NBA, NHL, NFL, MLB
								matches did not take place on the appointed days, then the bet amounts will be returned immediately the
								next day, except when in the case that the date was wrong.</p>
							<p>2.11. An event that is in progress may be interrupted,
								i.e. be incomplete for any reason. An event is considered to be held if it is interrupted, not finished
								within 24 hours, and if it is played at least:</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>- Football - 70 minutes;</p>
							<p>- Basketball (NBA) - 40 minutes;</p>
							<p>- European basketball - 35 minutes;</p>
							<p>- Hockey (NHL) - 54 minutes;</p>
							<p>- European hockey - 50 minutes;</p>
							<p>- Baseball (MLB) - 5 innings;</p>
							<p>- American football - 50 minutes;</p>
							<p>- Floorball - 60 minutes</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>In all the cases listed above, the outcome (actual
								result) of an event deemed to be held is the result at the time of the event's interruption (with the
								exception of tennis).</p>
							<p>In all other cases, the event is considered invalid,
								including in the case of a tie at the time of the match stopping in those sports where the statute does
								not allow for a draw (basketball, baseball, American football, the NHL playoff series, etc.) and all
								bets (including live bets) are refundable.</p>
							<p>If an event is interrupted and is considered to have not
								happened, then outcomes that have been definitely determined by the time the event stopped and which do
								not depend on the final result of the event (for example, a team will score a goal, who will score the
								first goal, results of the first half, etc.) are used to settle these bets (including live bets).
							</p>
							<p>2.12. When setting the bets that were placed on the
								statistics of one game day or round, if the tour is considered to have failed at least one or several
								matches, then the bets for the rounded statistics are settled with the odds of 1, except for bets whose
								result is uniquely determined regardless of the fact of whether or not the matches took place.
							</p>
							<p>2.13. Bets (including live bets) are considered canceled
								and refundable, regardless of whether or not they are winning or losing, if there are any errors
								committed due to a human factor or a software malfunction (including: obvious typos, inconsistencies of
								odds in different positions, knowingly erroneous odds that don;t correspond to the given outcomes,
								etc.).</p>
							<p>2.14. If a technical error occurs, but it can not affect
								the outcome of the event, such bets are settled based on the original odds.</p>
							<p>2.15. The company is not responsible for accurate
								translations of the names of players, teams, and cities where events will occur. In such cases, bets are
								considered valid.</p>
							<p>2.16. In the event of fraudulent actions, falsifications
								when accepting bets, or when illegal financial transactions are discovered by the Company's employees,
								no winnings are paid, and violators are banned from the website.</p>
							<p>If there are obvious signs of unsportsmanlike conduct or
								other cases of violation of these rules, the administration has the right to declare the bet
								invalid.</p>
							<p>In case of suspicion of unsportsmanlike conduct from
								international organizations for their prevention (EWS-FIFA, Federbet and Tennis Integrity Unit, etc.),
								the administration has the right to block the account of the Client who made a suspicious bet before
								leaving the organization and recognize the bets as invalid, if any unsportsmanlike conduct is indeed
								uncovered. The administration is not obliged to provide proof to the Clients of the unsportsmanlike
								nature of the event.</p>
							<p>2.17. Claims on contentious issues that are not solved in
								our technical support chat are accepted on the basis of an application to the Company's email so long as
								it is within 5 days from the date of completion of the event. When considering disputes that have no
								precedent and are unregulated in the text of these rules, the Company will make the final
								decision.</p>
							<p>2.18. A buyout of a bet is a feature by which the Client
								has the opportunity to close his bet for the amount offered by the Company and to forego the possible
								loss or gain when the outcome of the event becomes known.</p>
							<p>This feature will be available for all bets for which a
								special symbol of the "Bet Buyout" function is active in the "Bet History" section of the site. In this
								case, the Customer can click on the button and see the amount that the Company offers for the bid. The
								company can offer an amount that is lower, higher or equal to the possible winnings. The company also
								may not make offers.</p>
							<p>If the Customer agrees to receive the proposed amount,
								they must confirm their decision by clicking on the appropriate button. They will receive the amount
								proposed by the Company, after which the bet will close. If the Customer does not use this function or
								agrees with the proposed amount, their bet will be deemed effective until the end of the selected
								event.</p>
							<p>The feature may be available after the bet is completed
								before the end of the event, and the amount offered for the bet may vary depending on certain
								circumstances (for example, the amount of the bet, the bet odds, the event ratio determined at the time
								of use by the feature, and a discount determined by the Company, the latter of which is determined at
								the discretion of the Company).</p>
							<p>2.19. The maximum possible win of one bet can not exceed
								10;000 USD (EUR) or the equivalent in another currency that is accepted on the site.</p>
							<p>2.20. The minimum bet for Single bet and Accumulator bet
								players is 0.10 USD (EUR) or the equivalent in another currency. When placing Multiple bets - the
								minimum bet is 0.10 USD (EUR) or the equivalent in another currency.</p>
							<p>2.21. The maximum bet is determined by the bookmaking
								service for each separate event and depends on the sport and the event in question. If the Multi bet
								includes several events with different restrictions on the maximum bet, the maximum bet size is set
								equal to the minimum value. The maximum bid amount is available for viewing to the Customer in the
								website coupon.</p>
							<p>2.22. The bookmaker has the right to limit the maximum
								bet on individual events, as well as to limit or raise the maximum bet for a specific Customer without
								notification or explanation of its reasoning.</p>
							<p>2.23. The bet is considered accepted after its
								registration on the Company's server and online confirmation in the "Betting History" section.
								Registered bets are not subject to cancellation. The reception time of the bet is the time of its
								registration on the server.</p>
							<p>2.24. The bet amount can not exceed the current account
								balance. Bets on credit are not accepted. When registering a bet, the bet amount is debited from the
								Client's account. After settling the bet, the winnings are automatically credited to the account.
							</p>
							<p>A bet is considered to be won by the Client if all the
								outcomes specified in such a bet are guessed correctly.</p>
							<p>2.25. The fact of the accepted bet being won or not is
								determined by recording the fact of the chosen event or set of events having taken place, considering
								the outcome (result) of the event. The outcome (result) of the event is determined based on the
								information provided by the official Organizer and/or Organizers of the event. If the initial result of
								the event has been revoked for some reason later on, this fact isn;t considered and the bets are
								payable according to the initial (actual) results except if the original published results of the event
								are amended within 24 hours of their initial publication.</p>
							<p>2.26. If the initial result of the
								completed event was later canceled for any reason, the cancellation is not taken into account and the
								rates are to be paid according to the initial (actual) result. The result declared on the basis of
								official protocols and other official sources of information immediately after the event is deemed to
								be actual. In the absence of results in official sources, the Company has the right to use alternative
								sources of information, including the information of its representatives at the
								match.</p>

							<strong>3. Types of bets</strong>
							<p>3.1. <span>Single
									Bet</span> is a bet on the forecasted outcome for one event. The
								"single bet" win is equal to the product of the bet amount and the odds set for the given outcome of
								the event.</p>
							<p>3.2. <span>Accumulator
									Bet</span> is a bet for a simultaneous forecast of the outcomes of
								several independent events. The "accumulator bet" win is equal to the product of the bet amount and
								the "accumulator" odds, obtained by multiplying the outcome odds of each event included in the
								"accumulator". In the "accumulator" you can include any combination of outcomes of non-interconnected
								events in any sport. The "accumulator bet" is considered won if all events included in it are
								correctly predicted. Losing one of the outcomes means losing the entire bet of this type. The maximum
								number of events allowed in a multi bet is 30.</p>
							<p>3.3. <span>Multiple
									Bet</span> is a combination of accumulator bets of a given size from
								a predetermined number of events (the maximum number of events in a multi bet is 16).
							</p>
							<p>Each combination in the Multiple bet is settled as a
								separate Accumulator, according to the rules for the settlement of accumulator bets. When you place a
								Multiple bet, you must specify the total number of events for the Multiple bet and the number of events
								for one variant (multi bet). The bet for one variant in the Multiple bet is determined by dividing the
								total amount of the bet placed on the Multi bet by the number of variants (accumulators) of this
								Multiple bet. The winnings are equal to the sum of the wins for the "accumulator bets" that are included
								in the "Multiple bet".</p>
							<p>3.4. <span>Bets on the actual
									result of an event (Match)</span> - in this bet it is necessary to
								guess how the match will end. In the pre-game, the hosts' victory can also be displayed as "1", Draw
								as "X", the victory of the guests as "2".</p>
							<p>3.5. <span>Double
									chance</span> - bet on the double choice of the outcome of the
								match.</p>
							<p>The victory of the first team or a draw (the first team
								will not lose) - is denoted by "1X". To win at a bet on such a choice, it is necessary that the first
								team wins or a draw occurs.</p>
							<p>The victory of the first team or the victory of the
								second team (no draw) will be denoted by "12". To win with a bet on such a choice, it is necessary that
								one of the rivals win, i.e. so that there are no draws.</p>
							<p>The victory of the second team or a draw (the second team
								will not lose) - is denoted by "X2". To win a bet on such a choice, it is necessary that the second team
								wins or a draw occurs.</p>
							<p>3.6. <span>Handicap
									Odds</span>. The result of the event, taking into account the
								handicap, is determined by adding a handicap to the actual result of the match. The handicap is
								determined by the bookmaker's service and may be positive, negative or equal to zero. If the result is
								in favor of the selected team (athlete), the bet is considered won, otherwise, the bet is lost. If the
								result after adding a handicap is a draw, then the winning ratio for this choice will be "1" (Return
								or "Void").</p>
							<p>3.7. <span>Total</span>. It is necessary to guess the total number of goals,
								points, games (or
								other values that can be subjected to calculation); scored, scored, played, etc. teams (athletes). To
								win, you need to guess whether the total value will be scored/played, or less. When determining an
								individual total, only the goals scored in the opponent's goal are taken into account. If the result
								coincides with the total bookmaker's bid, the odds of wins at "less" or "higher" rates are considered
								equal to "1" (Return or "Void").</p>
							<p>3.8. <span>Asian handicap or asian
									total betting</span>. Bet on the win or total, taking into account
								the handicap, multiple of 0.25 (but not a multiple of 0.5). Such a bet is settled as two bets in the
								amount of half the sum, with the same odds, and with the nearest values of "ordinary odds" and
								"ordinary totals" (integer, or multiple 0.5). In the instance that the Asian handicap is included in
								the Accumulator bet or Multi bet, then the winning odds are used in settling this bet, which would be
								obtained when settling it in the single bet. In the case of winning both half bets, the settlement of
								the bet odds (K). If one half bet won as well as the other, the odds (K + 1) / 2 are taken into
								account in the settlement. If one half bet is lost and another is lost, the odds are 0.5. If both half
								bets are lost, then the entire bet is lost.</p>
							<p>3.9. <span>A bet on the time
									remaining in a half / period / match</span>: for such a bet, the
								customer has to predict the outcome of a game or match between teams for a specified period of time,
								which starts when the bet is placed and ends when the match (or half, period, etc.) ends, without
								taking into account the score at the time the bet was placed.</p>
							<p>3.10. <span>Bets on the outcomes
									of two or more events</span> - for example, the first team wins and
								total is over 2.5 goals or the first team wins, the number of warnings (yellow cards) will be more
								than 3.5 and the number of corner kicks - less than 10, etc.</p>
							<p>3.11. <span>Bets on the time when
									a certain event will take place</span> - when the first corner,
								first goal, etc. will take place.</p>
							<p>3.12. The company may, at its discretion, offer other
								betting options.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="static-page__paragraph">

								inclusively), how the first goal in the match will be scored (with the game not with the head, with the
								head, with a penalty, against a penalty, an own goal, etc.). If the match ends with a score of 0:0, then
								the bets are considered lost.</p>
							<p>4.1.5. Bets on which team will score the second goal in
								the match, in which time interval the second goal in the match will be scored (intervals of minutes are
								indicated inclusively). If the match ends with a score of 0:0, 1:0, or 0:1, then the bets are considered
								lost.</p>
							<p>4.1.6. Bets on which team will score the last goal in the

								awarded or not.</p>
							<p>4.1.9. It is proposed to guess whether there will be a
								removal (red card) in the match or not.</p>
							<p>4.1.10. It is suggested to guess whether the total number

								which player will be given the first warning in the match (in case, according to the match protocol, the
								event occurred in both teams on the same minute, the bet is returned), if there are no warnings in the
								match, in which period of time the first warning will be issued (the intervals of minutes are indicated
								inclusively). If a player has been removed from the field as a result of two yellow cards, then only one
								of them is taken into account during the bet settlement.</p>

								cards that are presented to the team players during direct participation in the game are
								considered.</p>
							<p>4.1.12. It is suggested to guess whether the total number
								of replacements made by the team is greater or less than the specified total value.</p>

								first substitution (if according to the game protocol this event occurred at the same minute for both
								teams, the bet amount is to be returned), guess in what time interval the first substitution will occur
								in one of the teams (intervals of minutes are indicated inclusively), whether the player who came on the
