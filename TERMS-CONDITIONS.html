									the bonus.</span></p>

							<p><span>27.5. Persistent misuse of bonuses</span></p>
							<p><span>The bonus is considered to be a kind of present and encouragement to the

							<p><span>As a part of providing protection against all kinds of fraudulent schemes
									Magic Reels reserves the right to check the payment and gaming activity of customers at any
									time. And in case of identifying persistent misuse of bonuses Magic Reels has the right to take
									measures providing for either disabling the possibility of receiving bonuses in the future, or
									obtaining compensation for losses incurred.</span></p>
							<p><span>In order to avoid questionable interpretation of the rules, we give
									several examples of a dishonest games. The full list of abuse is not limited by the descriptions
									provided below.</span></p>
							<p><span>Example 1: The gamer makes many bets with the minimum expected win in
									order to get more bets and to wager the bonus as soon as possible. For example, making bets on all
									numbers in roulette, or on black / red and any other identical bets. This can be considered as
									persistent misuse of the bonus and lead to additional verification and possible block of an
									account.</span></p>
							<p><span>Example 2: The gamer makes high bets to get money on his / her balance
									quickly and then decreases bets radically (in 2 or more times) in order to wager the bonus with less
									risks with an increased balance. Such situations will also be subject to verification and may lead to
									the account closure.</span></p>
							<p><span>Any combination which has any of the elements of the examples mentioned
									above, and leads to a potential persistent misuse of the bonus policy may be an occasion for
									additional verification.</span></p>
							<p><span>Pay attention to the fact that a confirmed phone number is obligatory for
									confirming the identity and is a guarantee for receiving the bonuses; in the case if these conditions
									are not fulfilled, the client may be suspended from the bonus policy of the Site.</span></p>
							<p><span>Magic Reels reserves the right to change the Terms of its bonus policy
									any time. The client takes responsibility to keep abreast of the most relevant information regarding
									this issue.</span></p>
							<p><span>It is forbidden to postpone any game rounds, including free spins or
									bonus games. In case of the discovery of deferred rounds, the casino reserves the right to block the
									player's account and confiscate all funds.</span></p>
							<p><span>27.6. Management of casino can set the restrictions for the max
									money amount which can be received from the active bonus.</span></p>
							<p><span>27.7. When using an activated bonus, the real money from the
									player's account is used first and only then the bonus money, unless otherwise stated.</span></p>
