							<strong>Responsible Gambling.</strong>
							<p>Magic Reels approaches responsible gaming as one of the key standards for serving its
								customers. Our actions are aimed to ensure you to get maximum pleasure from the game, and at the same
								time
								to perceive the process of playing in a casino as entertainment. It is very important to be aware of
								potential risks, both financial and social.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="static-page__paragraph">
							<strong>Maintaining control</strong>
							<p>It is important to consider gambling as a means of entertainment, and not as a source of
								additional income or profit. Mind your time spent at the casino as a vacation, keep your expenses under
								control, and don’t be inclined to risk and lose money that are potentially important for you.</p>
							<p>To help you to maintain control over yourself, we give you a few simple rules:</p>
							<p>Think of the game as part of a relaxing process, not a profit-making process;</p>
							<p>In case of loss do not try to recoup at that moment; You can return to the game after a
								while
							</p>
							<p> Never play for amounts which loss may be significant to you;</p>
							<p>Control the time and money spent during the game process;</p>
							<p>If you think that you need to take a break, then write to our Support Service, and we will
								disconnect you from the service for a while. Please note that account blocking, in this case, is
								possible
								only after a call from the support manager to the account owner.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="static-page__paragraph">
							<strong>In case of any problems</strong>
							<p> If you have a suspicion that you have some problems with the game, then below we give questions that
								will help you to find it out</p>
							<p> Does the game stop you from attending work or school?</p>
							<p> Do you play just to spend time or to avoid boredom?</p>
							<p> Do you play alone for a long time?</p>
							<p> Did someone tell you that you spend too much time on gambling?</p>
							<p> Have you started to spend less time with family and friends because you began to spend more time
								playing?</p>
							<p> Have you ever lied about how much time and money you spent on a game?</p>
							<p>Have you ever stolen or lied in order to play more?</p>
							<p> Are you reluctant to spend playing money on something else?</p>
							<p>How often do you not stop until you lose all the money?</p>
							<p> Do you often want to win back money immediately after losing?</p>
							<p> Do you feel confused and desperate after losing money?</p>
							<p> Can any problems, disappointments, and frustrations make you want to start the game?</p>
							<p> Do gambling lead to depression and suicidal thoughts?</p>
							<p> A large number of affirmative answers indicate probable difficulties with the game process. You can
								get
								advice on this topic with organizations from the list below.</p>
